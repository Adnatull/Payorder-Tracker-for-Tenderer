# Payorder-Tracker-for-Tenderer

A web application for tenderers based on Bangladesh. Tenderers tend to submit a lot of tender applications to get contracts of works. Before that tenderers need to show security assets(money) in bank and show a payorder. Big tenderers often forget which tender he got and which was refused. This app will help to track payorders and tenderers can easily see which tender they did not get and by knowing that they can get refund of the money of that payorder. 

The application is in under development.
